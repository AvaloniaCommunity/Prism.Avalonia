# Prism.Avalonia
Prism (https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) framework support for Avalonia UI

This library actually copies functionality of Prism for WPF implementation, which can be found here:
https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/tree/master/Source/Wpf
  
Logic and approach for development your applications remained the same as it was for Prism.Wpf library. 
The only things that havent done yet:
-Prism.Avalonia not supports ability to bind Region to ItemsSource element
