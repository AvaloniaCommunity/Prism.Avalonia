 [Prism.Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Prism.Avalonia) provides your cross-platform [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) apps with [Prism library](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) support so you can **Navigate**, create **Dialog Windows** and **Notifications**, provide **Dependency Injection** and internal **Messaging** easier than before!  You will need both packages installed to get started.

> **Announcement!**
>
> * **NEW:** _[Official Prism.Avalonia Templates arrived!](https://github.com/SuessLabs/Prism.Avalonia.Templates)_
> * _Prism.Avalonia v9.0.537 - **Available!**_
> * Check out the [Upgrading to Prism v9.0](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Prism.Avalonia/wiki/Upgrading-to-Prism-v9.0) guide to avoid breaking changes in your apps

With Prism.Avalonia's logic and development approach being **similar** to that of [Prism for WPF](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/), so you can get started right away! Keep in mind, they are **similar** and not 1-to-1. Check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Prism.Avalonia/wiki) and [Avalonia Outlookish](https://github.com/DamianSuess/Learn.PrismAvaloniaOutlookish) app for tips and tricks.

This project currently supports cross-platform Desktop applications (_Windows, Linux, Mac_). Support for Android, iOS, and web apps is still under evaluation; and is not 100%. Feel free to contribute and help us improve. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Package Releases

Just like _Prism.WPF or Prism.Maui_, your project must reference both the **Prism.Avalonia** (_Core_) and **Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia** (_IoC container_) packages to work.

| Package | Stable | Preview
|-|-|-|
| Prism.Avalonia | [![Prism.Avalonia NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Prism.Avalonia?dWidth=70&includePreReleases=false)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.Avalonia/) | [![Prism.Avalonia NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Prism.Avalonia?dWidth=70&includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.Avalonia/)
| Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia | [![Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia?dWidth=70&includePreReleases=false)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia/) | [![Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia?dWidth=70&includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia/)

### Version Notice

Choose the NuGet package version that matches your Avalonia version.

Our [versioning schema](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Prism.Avalonia/wiki/Versioning-Schema) is based on the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) using the format  `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.REVISION`. The `REVISION` segment indicates the Avalonia version support. For instance `v9.0.537.11234` equates to, Prism `v9.0.537`, Avalonia `v11.2.3`, _revision_ `4`.

| Prism | Avalonia | Prism.Avalonia NuGet Package
|-|-|-
| v9.0.537  | **11.1.3**    | v9.0.537.11130 ([Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.Avalonia/9.0.537.11130)) ([DryIoc](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia/9.0.537.11130))

You can contribute today by creating a **feature request**, **issue**, or **discussion** on the forum. From there we can have a brief discussion as to where this fits into the backlog priority.

## Install

Add the Prism.Avalonia and its DryIoc packages to your project:

```powershell
# Avalonia v11.1 - Latest Release
Install-Package Prism.Avalonia -Version 9.0.537.11130
Install-Package Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia -Version 9.0.537.11130

# Legacy: Avalonia v11.0
Install-Package Prism.Avalonia -Version 8.1.97.11073
Install-Package Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia -Version 8.1.97.11073

# Legacy: Avalonia v0.10.1021
Install-Package Prism.Avalonia -Version 8.1.97.1021
Install-Package Prism.DryIoc.Avalonia -Version 8.1.97.1021
```

## How to use

### Program.cs

The default Avalonia entrypoint `Program.cs` does not need to be modified. Below is provided as a sample.

```csharp
using System;
using Avalonia;

namespace SampleBaseApp;

internal sealed class Program
{
  // Initialization code. Don't use any Avalonia, third-party APIs or any
  // SynchronizationContext-reliant code before AppMain is called
  [STAThread]
  public static void Main(string[] args) => BuildAvaloniaApp()
    .StartWithClassicDesktopLifetime(args);

  // Avalonia configuration, don't remove; also used by visual designer.
  public static AppBuilder BuildAvaloniaApp()
    => AppBuilder.Configure<App>()
        .UsePlatformDetect()
        .WithInterFont()
        .LogToTrace();
}

```

### App.axaml

```xml
<Application xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             x:Class="SampleBaseApp.App"
             xmlns:local="using:SampleBaseApp"
             RequestedThemeVariant="Default">
  <!-- RequestedThemeVariant allows for the following types, "Default", "Dark", or "Light". -->

  <Application.Styles>
    <FluentTheme />
  </Application.Styles>
</Application>
```

### App.axaml.cs

> **Notice:**
>
> We do not need the `OnFrameworkInitializationCompleted()` method. However, you must include `base.Initialize();` in the `Initialize()` method to kick-start Prism.Avalonia.
>
> Also, in your `App.axaml` you no longer need to device the `<Design.DataContext>`. Prism takes care of this for you! (:

```csharp
using System;
using Avalonia;
using Avalonia.Markup.Xaml;
using Prism.DryIoc;
using Prism.Ioc;
using SampleBaseApp.Views;

namespace SampleBaseApp;

public partial class App : PrismApplication
{
  public override void Initialize()
  {
    AvaloniaXamlLoader.Load(this);
    base.Initialize();  // Required to initialize Prism.Avalonia - DO NOT REMOVE
  }

  protected override AvaloniaObject CreateShell()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("CreateShell()");

    return Container.Resolve<MainWindow>();
  }

  protected override void RegisterTypes(IContainerRegistry containerRegistry)
  {
    // Add Services and ViewModel registrations here

    Console.WriteLine("RegisterTypes()");

    // Services
    //// containerRegistry.RegisterSingleton<ISampleService, ISampleService>();

    // Views - Region Navigation
    //// containerRegistry.RegisterForNavigation<DashboardView, DashboardViewModel>();

    // Dialogs
    //// containerRegistry.RegisterDialog<MessageBoxView, MessageBoxViewModel>();
    //// containerRegistry.RegisterDialogWindow<CustomDialogWindow>(nameof(CustomDialogWindow));
  }

    protected override void ConfigureModuleCatalog(IModuleCatalog moduleCatalog)
    {
      // Register modules
      //// moduleCatalog.AddModule<DummyModule.DummyModule1>();
    }
```

## House Keeping

### Branching Strategy

Below is a basic branching hierarchy and strategy.

| Branch | Purpose
|-|-|
| `master`    | All releases are tagged published using the `master` branch
| `develop`   | The **default** & active development branch. When a feature set is completed and ready for public release, the `develop` branch will be merged into `master` and a new NuGet package will be published.
| `feature/*` | New feature branch. Once completed, it is merged into `develop` and the branch must be deleted.
| `stable/*`  | Stable release base build which shares cherry-picked merges from `develop`. This branch **must not** be deleted.
