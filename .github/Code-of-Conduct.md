# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation and knowledge readily available to others. We inspire everyone to learn from one another, to share ideas, and help grow the community.

## Our Standards

* Focus on what is best to improve the project's codebase
* Give constructive feedback
* Be respectful towards one another
* Feedback is welcome
* Jokes are welcomed - _don't like it, rub dirt on it_
* _Keep political views out of code_

After all, we're all human.. _except for AI, that's just an algorithm_.
